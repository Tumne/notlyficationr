# Notlyficationr

_Because you can never have too unique of a name_

This is a basic note taking app built in react typescript. A single user can create, view, edit, and delete basic notes. The state management is handled using Reactâ€™s Context API. The persistent data is stored using localStorage.

(any stylish resemblance to Notion or Bear's notetaking app is strictly coincidental ðŸ˜‰)
